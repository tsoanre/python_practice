# Different types of tuples

# Empty tuple
# my_tuple = ()
# print(my_tuple)

# # Tuple having integers
# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# print(my_tuple)

# # tuple with mixed datatypes
# my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
# print(my_tuple)

# # nested tuple
# my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
# print(my_tuple)

# t = ('TANUJ','SHUBHAM','VIDHAN')
# a,b,c = t
# print(a) 
# print(b) 
# print(c)


# single ELement tuple 
# t = ('TANUJ',)

# tuple indexing
my_tuple = ('p','e','r','m','i','t')

print(my_tuple[0])  
print(my_tuple[5]) 

#concatination and all dlt pop remove same as list.
